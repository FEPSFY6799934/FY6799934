  The Mariana Trench holds the world record for the deepest location in the ocean 
  spanning down to 36000 feet below sea level. Due to these depths the immense
  pressure of the sea water would be equivalent to no life existing. There is also 
  a lack of sunlight with temperatures being extremely low or even hot in certain 
  areas. Even so, there still manages to have sea life exist down in these far depths.

<pre style="font-family: Arial">
  Also known as the Mariana Trench, this is confirmed to be the place holding the
  world record of being about 36000 feet or 11000 meters deep back in 2019. This
  trench is a chasm found in the western Pacific Ocean spanning over 1580 miles.
  For every 10 meters (33 feet), that you travel beneath the ocean’s surface, the
  pressure increases by 14.7 pounds per square inch which is 10335.12 kilograms 
  per metre squared. The Mariana Trench is also deeper than the tallest mountain
  in the world, Mount Everest. What’s more is that the peak of the mountain would
  still be unable to get close to the water surface simply because of the 
  Trench's’ depth (Serpette, 2020). 

  Even with a severe lack of sunlight that cannot penetrate to the depths of this 
  trench. There are over 200 known organisms including crustaceans and amphipods. 
  Since sunlight doesn’t reach far down, it is a correction assumption that water
  temperatures would be cold, which is correct. The temperature tends to be one to 
  four degrees Celsius at best. However, there are certain areas that have
  hydrothermal vents that release water up to 370 degrees Celsius. At the same time, 
  water released from these vents have many minerals which support a vast majority 
  of the organisms (Serpette, 2020).

  As mentioned before, sea life down at these dangerous depths would surely crush 
  and kill everything below. However, this is not the case. We have the Vampire squid which came from hell, looking at this
  squid, it would be safe to assume a terrifying nature, yet this is not the case. This creature lives off eating particles
  called ‘marine snow’ enough to support its lifestyle (ocean.si.edu).
  Next, we have the Dumbo octopus, this octopus scales between 20 to 30 centimetres big. What’s more is that its body consists
  of being more gelatinous, so thanks to the immense water pressure found down below, it can carry on living. If this octopus 
  were to be brought up to the surface or even close to the surface, its own body would implode on itself because of not having 
  pressure strong enough to keep it intact (oceaninfo.com).

  A more famous creature is the Angler fish, I’m sure many people would be familiar with this one from Finding Nemo. This fish 
  has a bioluminescent lure attached to its head which is a fancy way of saying this fish produces its own light even as far 
  down as it is. It uses this light to attract other creatures near to prey on and consume. Interestingly, the female anglers grow
  up to eight inches long and the males only up to one inch. In turn, the male's fuse into the females making the two become 
  just one (oceaninfo.com).
    
  Another creepy looking creature is the frilled shark, which has been around for more than 80 million years. This shark was discovered by 
  German ichthyologist Ludwig H.P. Döderlein in the 19th century. The shark was described to be a living fossil because of its appearance 
  and mouth shape. An eel-like body to boot and skin that is dark brown to grey and amphistyly which relates to its articulation of the jaw 
  to its head. The teeth are spaced generously with 19 to 28 in the upper jaw and 21 to 29 in the lower jaw. Finding this shark will be more 
  common if you stick to the ocean floor and biologically productive locations (oceaninfo.com).

  Sharks come in many different shapes and sizes, with this shark which just so happens to be called the goblin shark (look at figure 1)
  growing up to 10-13 feet in length. Just like the frilled shark, in terms of appearance this shark has one of the
  creepiest if not the creepiest appearance out of the shark family. With an unusual snout that scientists have no
  clue what it’s for and a mouth that extends disturbingly far out when trying to catch its prey. Something as rare as
  this just so happens to have absurdly sharp teeth and a skin complexion that looks almost unnatural on a shark being
  pink oned (oceaninfo.com).  
    
  Zombies do indeed exist, maybe not as how we imagined, but as worms found deep down in the seafloor. However familiar we
  believe we are to understanding zombie likes and dislikes, these zombie worms have zero interest in brains, they hunt
  for bones. These little guys group up to seven centimetres long or one to three inches. Also known as Osedax worms,
  these were discovered living inside the bones of a rotting grey whale around 10,000 feet deep back in 2002. Even
  though bones are the target, these worms dig deeper, these worms seek out the fat found inside the bones and use acid
  coming out from their skin to be able to breakdown the bones and get to the fat inside the bones. Just like the angler
  fish, only the females hunt for bones, the males are microscopic and live inside of the females (ocean.si.edu).
