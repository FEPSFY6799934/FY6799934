  Over the course of technological advancement, we have only mapped out 20% of our 
  oceans with 5% having been explored (Keaveny, 2023). Our ability to design and 
  create new submarines that can withstand the pressures of thousands ofmeters 
  below sea level has enabled us to discover new oceanic creatures, of which are 
  very bizarre to look at. The discovery of new sea life which we have never seen 
  before, or even things that quite deliberately look alien on this very planet. 
  Due to the pressure of a depth of more than7000 metres, creatures that can survive 
  are unable to ever reach the surface otherwise imploding on themselves is quite
  the possibility.

  Also known as the Mariana Trench, this is confirmed to be the place holding the
  world record of being about 36000 feet or 11000 meters deep back in 2019. This
  trench is a chasm found in the western Pacific Ocean spanning over 1580 miles.
  For every 10 meters (33 feet), that you travel beneath the ocean’s surface, the
  pressure increases by 14.7 pounds per square inch which is 10335.12 kilograms 
  per metre squared.The Mariana Trench is also deeper than the tallest mountain
  in the world, Mount Everest. What’s more is that the peak of the mountain would
  still be unable to get close to the water surface simply because of the 
  Trench's’ depth (Serpette, 2020). 

  Even with a severe lack of sunlight that cannot penetrate to the depths of this 
  trench. There are over 200 known organisms including crustaceans and amphipods. 
  Since sunlight doesn’t reach far down, it is a correction assumption that water
  temperatures would be cold, which is correct. The temperature tends to be one to 
  four degrees Celsius at best. However, there are certain areas that have
  hydrothermal vents that release water up to 370 degrees Celsius. At the same time, 
  water released from these vents have many minerals which support a vast majority 
  of the organisms (Serpette, 2020).

  As mentioned before, sea life down at these dangerous depths would surely crush 
  and kill everything below. However, this is not the case. We have the Vampire squid which came from hell, looking at this
  squid, it would be safe to assume a terrifying nature, yet this is not the case. This creature lives off eating particles
  called ‘marine snow’ enough to support its lifestyle (ocean.si.edu).
  Next, we have the Dumbo octopus, this octopus scales between 20 to 30 centimetres big. What’s more is that its body consists
  of being more gelatinous, so thanks to the immense water pressure found down below, it can carry on living. If this octopus 
  were to be brought up to the surface or even close to the surface, its own body would implode on itself because of not having 
  pressure strong enough to keep it intact (oceaninfo.com).

  A more famous creature is the Angler fish, I’m sure many people would be familiar with this one from Finding Nemo. This fish 
  has a bioluminescent lure attached to its head which is a fancy way of saying this fish produces its own light even as far 
  down as it is. It uses this light to attract other creatures near to prey on and consume. Interestingly, the female anglers grow
  up to eight inches long and the males only up to one inch. In turn, the male's fuse into the females making the two become 
  just one (oceaninfo.com).
    
  Another creepy looking creature is the frilled shark, which has been around for more than 80 million years. This shark was discovered by 
  German ichthyologist Ludwig H.P. Döderlein in the 19th century. The shark was described to be a living fossil because of its appearance 
  and mouth shape. An eel-like body to boot and skin that is dark brown to grey and amphistyly which relates to its articulation of the jaw 
  to its head. The teeth are spaced generously with 19 to 28 in the upper jaw and 21 to 29 in the lower jaw. Finding this shark will be more 
  common if you stick to the ocean floor and biologically productive locations (oceaninfo.com).
